WIND_INCOME_MULTIPLIER = 1.6					-- because MF wind generators produce +60% relative to the standard
WIND_ALTITUDE_EXTRA_INCOME_FRACTION = 0.4		-- up to extra 40% from being built on relatively high altitude   
WIND_STR_CAP = 40								-- the base wind strength cap on generators
EXCESS_WIND_REDUCTION_MULT = 0.85 		-- to compensate for the fact that the actual average is higher than expected
