--- Balance / Mechanics

TARGETTING

- removed height range bonus from cannon type weapons
(this slightly reduces the range of cannon and missiles fired from aircraft at ground targets and makes relative ranges of missile and cannon artillery more consistent)
- removed the 33% vertical range stretch from laser/beam weapons 
(they'd fire and apparently hit but deal no damage past their normal max range)

- GEAR and CLAW pop-up static defenses will now open up if enemy long range rockets get within ~150% of their range
(the ones that can hit air well)

- cloakable radar jammers are cloaked by default

- removed 100 energy and metal storage from commander pads

- increased cost of L2 fusion reactors by 6%

--- UI / Visual

- railgun projectiles are no longer visible by enemies outside of LOS coverage
(a known issue is that now they're also not visible by allies outside of LOS and should be)

- fixed DC rocket auto-build green effect sometimes persisting if the unit is destroyed while the auto-build buff is still active

- reduced the cost of hypersonic nukes from 25k to 24k metal and increased the maximum damage from 12000 to 13000

--- AI

- when attack units are not "seriously damaged", evasion maneuvers are done towards the enemies instead of away from them
- added "retreat health fraction" parameters for commanders/assaults/other for custom strategies

--- new units

- GEAR "Rager" : level 2 cloakable armored fire support robot

(the evaluation formula was adjusted to increase their cost a bit so they end up about even)
(they no longer outrange the forward weapons even if upgraded)

- CLAW miniguns are slightly more efficient at hitting small strafing air targets
- CLAW big railgun projectiles now keep going past their max range and have a slight arc to their trajectory
(the visual changed slightly)

--- Balance / Mechanics

- units that stop being captured start losing 1% of their capture status every second

- reduced speed % drop ground units suffer while turning from 33% to about 25%
(it should be 0 for soft turns but isn't due to an engine issue)

- SPHERE "Helix" got about 10% higher dmg/s and 10% more range but is about 20% more expensive
(the turret on the 3D model gets a bit bigger and more menacing)
- SPHERE "Golem" is now 15% slower, has HP increased to 8000 and higher dmg/s on the missiles and is about 15% more expensive
(the sound of the cannon also changed to differentiate it from charger's)

- attempt to improve aiming for CLAW Brute and AVEN "Zeta form" commander
(to avoid weapons locking up as they try to aim at different targets)

- added AI support for custom strategies
 (these are loaded from LuaUI/Configs/mf_strategies.json on the user's Spring directory - check the strategy editor on the web site)
- allow STRATEGY commands from enemies if specific player numbers were used, the AI has no human allies and only during the first minute
(this can be useful for players to play against AI that use their own custom strategies)



2020/10/11 ------------------ NOTES v1.44 ----------------------


--- Balance / Mechanics

WATER
- increased range of level1 static sonar stations from 1200 to 1400
- reduced sonar range of submarines (level1 and 2) from 600+ to 500
(helps making them cheaper, but level 2 submarines now require external sonar)
- all submarines can now reverse at half their normal maximum speed
- modified AVEN "Crusader"'s cannon to have slightly less range, faster projectile and higher dmg/s with shorter reload time and M damage instead of H
- made level 2 radar/sonar ships slower and reduced their HP to reduce costs

- added #AI COMPAD command : gets the AI to share a commander respawner pad to the player
- beacon markers should now appear to allies and spectators only
- check if the surrounding area is suitable for making factories when placing construction towers


2020/10/04 ------------------ NOTES v1.42 ----------------------

--- Balance / Mechanics

AIR
- increase gear vector flare range by ~7% and energy cost to fire to 50E/s and adjusted cost
- reduce sphere twilight laser range and adjusted cost
- modified how weapons are evaluated and slightly reduced their range to make fast level 1 fighter aircraft cheaper relative to their level 2 counterparts
(a fix to how CLAW Hornet's weapon is evaluated for consistency purposes actually makes it slighly more expensive)
- increased projectile speed for AVEN, CLAW and SPHERE "M" damage type air-to-ground rockets and increased the unit costs by 5-10%
- SPHERE "Tycho" : slightly reduced the weapon range and HP, removed 3-shot burst and increased maneuverability

AMPHIBIOUS
- AVEN, GEAR and CLAW level 1 floating torpedo launchers get the same discount as water-locked ships (15%)
- CLAW "Sinker" gets the same 600 range sonar as the other L1 torpedo launchers
- level 2 vehicle plants can now make amphibious boats but they only get 5% discount instead of the 15% discount water-locked ships get
(they have a 33% speed penalty on land)

OTHER
- increased CLAW "Boar"'s precision and reduced SPHERE "Double"'s precision so it's the same (has a tiny impact on unit costs, < 2%)

--- AI fixes

- non-classic AI strategies build torpedo launchers on water
- construction towers will avoid building factories obstructed by features (which might be out of range of the tower)
- AVEN, GEAR and CLAW assault strategies will also build a few raiders
- improved how units avoid enemies when retreating (most relevant for AI raiders and aircraft)


--- VISUALS

- reduced the size and length of the CLAW railgun projectiles



2020/09/27 ------------------ NOTES v1.41 ----------------------

--- Balance / Mechanics

- removed debug log that happened when drones moved away from the parent unit
- reduced the vertical speed of SPHERE's slow flying spheres to match their movement speed

- SPHERE "Gazer" flying sphere and commander forms now deal about 50% more damage per shot and have about 50% higher reload time
(They also got new visuals. The commander got its HP reduced from 4600 to 4500 to compensate)

- modified how the 360  weapons on strafing level 2 fighters are accounted for and slightly reduced their range and damage to compensate
- GEAR "Vector"'s flare no longer gets cylindrical targetting with 2x height boost due to being a "missile" type
(this was letting it outrange ground-based lasers too easily)

- increased GEAR "Cascade" cost by 13%

- reduced imprecision of most 500-1500 range plasma cannons by about half (this has a minor effect on unit costs, less than 3% in most cases)


--- AI fixes

- fixed AI sometimes still blocking its factories with other factories or advanced metal extractors
- modified the AI upgrade paths so it starts with the major regen upgrade, for now
 (simple change that helps it keep its armies repaired)
- made AI more likely to build adv extractors sooner
- AI builders will now prioritize repairing nearby damaged units instead of assisting construction
- fixed AI not using units given to it
- fixed "brutal" mode not getting the resource bonus when using strategies

TRANSPORTS
- air transports now lose up to 55% of their maximum speed when carrying heavy loads (up from 50%)
- increased the cost of level 2 air transports from 1200m to 1400m

CONSTRUCTION UNITS
- AVEN and CLAW level 2 construction robots become all-terrain
- GEAR level 2 construction robot becomes slower, more expensive, H armored and spawns 1 air transport drone which can carry itself uphill
- all level 2 construction units become more expensive but significantly tougher to enable their usage as front line combat engineers
- SPHERE level 1 construction vehicle is now M armored but slightly slower and more expensive
- all aircraft factories are now buildable on water

- wreckages now take about 3x as long to reclaim (half of the time it would take to build the original unit)

OTHER
- reduced AVEN "Knight"'s projectile speed, increased "pose" dmg reduction from 20 to 25% and reduced cost by about 5%
- reduced AVEN "Shocker"'s speed by about 20%, increased hp by 100, range by 10%, changed armor type from M to H and increased cost by about 20%

(it's should now be very effective vs air units)

- GEAR "Canister" is 5% more expensive
- GEAR "Thud" shoots more accurately now, especially in high trajectory mode
- GEAR "Rhino" is 5% more expensive
- increased GEAR "Box" HP from 1650 to 1850 and adjusted cost

- SPHERE "Hanz" had its weapon accuracy improved

- setting units to their cloaked state changes the fire state to "Return Fire" instead of "Hold Fire"

- made dragon's teeth being built neutral so they don't "bait" enemy fire
- made dragon's teeth not spawn the feature if they're destroyed before being fully built to avoid a possible "free" metal exploit

(this should fix the issue where strafing aircraft would sometimes refuse to turn back and fly into enemy defenses)

- fixed bug where occasionally drones would persist after the parent unit was destroyed

- SPHERE "Shielder" can no longer be given "attack" orders to avoid it trying to ram enemy units

- modified how unit masses are calculated to make L armored units lighter and H armored units heavier

- SPHERE intelligence Drones now have their HP reduced from 1000 to 600 HP but get the "scoper" ability 

- fixed a bug where shielded hit by paralyze damage would be able to fire while still being attached to air transports
(as a side effect transported units no longer take paralyze damage)

- removed a discount factor for air-borne short-ranged lasers as they don't get blocked by obstacles
(the only noteworthy impact of this was increasing GEAR "Zipper" cost by 5%) 

- reduced the reference flight altitude of level 2 fighter aircraft from 240 to 210

- reduced the limit of commander weapon range upgrades from 2 to 1



--- AI / MFAI

- AI units will now move away to keep their distance from enemies that get close (on normal and brutal)
- will build sets of 4 solar collectors, wind or tidal generators for a more compact base
- added standard format to define AI strategies. The new naming convention for MFAI is MFAI : <difficulty> (strategy)
- renamed previous AI behavior as "classic" and added a new default strategy which is flexible (picks a specific strategy according to the map)
- added a set of more specific AI strategies:
	. Air
	. Assault
	. Skirmisher
	. Amphibious
- AI may nuke its enemies depending on the strategy (if non-classic)
- fixed issue which could lead to some builders getting stuck idling
- avoid building fusion reactors adjacent to factories (it would sometimes lead to them getting stuck)
- non-classic AI can use construction towers to speed up their early game
- non-classic AI will build metal makers
- added AI beacon which can be used to force AI to move to a position, can be used offensively or defensively
(CTRL+ALT+CLICK to set, CTRL+ALT+RIGHT_CLICK to clear)

WARNING : AI CHANGES ARE STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND HAVE SOME ISSUES

--- UI

- increased horizontal size of game end awards panel to allow longer player names
- slightly modified how chat messages from different sources are colored








2020/06/04 ------------------ NOTES v1.39 ----------------------

- modified how shield HP is factored into the costs of shielded units, including area shields
(this makes them about 5-15% more expensive)

- modified how weapon dmg/s, aoe, spike damage and range are factored into the weapon values and unit costs

- increased AVEN "Samson" HP from 700 to 820 and adjusted cost
- increased CLAW "Grunt" HP from 850 to 950 and adjusted cost
- made most units with 380-500 range L lasers prioritize air targets and have a slight energy cost to fire
(20% of their dmg/s, this makes them about 5-10% cheaper)
- reduced cost of radars by 5-10%

- fixed an issue with air tranports sometimes not being able to load or unload units on water
- increased the death blast damage and radius of AVEN mobile fusion reactors from 800 to 1900 with 500 radius


--- UI / Visuals

- reduced CLAW "Slayer" commander form's range by 10% and damage by 5%
- small adjustments in speed and HP (<5%) on several commander forms to even them out due to evaluation rules changes (penalizing the slower ones relative to the fast ones)


LONG RANGE ROCKETS
- reduced SPHERE "Meteorite" rocket's speed by 20% (note that it also lacks the terminal speedup the others have)
- set AVEN "Lightning" rocket's paralyze time to 30s

WATER
- changed many of the level 2 torpedo weapons to Heavy Torpedoes with 120 AOE and adjusted the costs
- AVEN "Piranha" and GEAR "Noser" get slower and Heavy Torpedoes with higher dmg/s as a weapon (Noser also gets 850 range)
- CLAW "Monster" is slower but has more HP and shoots faster "M" damage torpedoes
(these are meant to make them more effective against an enemy which only have t1 subs)

OTHER
- GEAR "Igniter" gets increased cost and about 10% reduction in speed and HP but has tracking incendiary missiles which can now hit air
- AVEN "Warrior" gets slightly slower and now has EMG on both arms and a missile launcher backpack which hits air units


--- UI / Visuals

- added more distinctive visual effects to GEAR "Vector" flares
- modified 3rd ally color to differentiate from 2nd (previously the shades of green were hard to tell apart)




2020/05/05 ------------------ NOTES v1.34 ----------------------

--- new units

- added AVEN "Lightning" : long range rocket which damages and paralyzes units 
- added GEAR "Pyroclasm" : long range rocket which separates into 6 untargetable incendiary submunitions when approaching the target
- added CLAW "Impaler" : long range rocket which shoots an untargetable very fast projectile when approaching the target
- added SPHERE "meteorite" : armored long range rocket with a relatively weaker warhead

--- Balance / Mechanics


FIGHTERS / AIR
- GEAR "Instigator" and SPHERE "Crustle" no longer avoid targetting air units if there are ground units in range
- GEAR "Firestorm" : increased HP by 50%, reduced speed by 20% and adjusted cost
- SPHERE "Meteor" will no longer try to chase enemy air targets

- AVEN "Swift" and GEAR "Dash" now have shorter range missiles with less burst, higher dmg/s and faster reload time


- GEAR "Luminator" : reduced reload time from 15s to 12s and adjusted cost

- AVEN hovercraft plant and CLAW spinbot plant now also build l1 land and ship construction units
(this is meant to make them more viable as starting factories)

- long range rocket explosions deal only 10% damage to other rockets in flight


OTHER
- fixed scopers and comsat stations decloaking units when their projectiles hit
- SPHERE magnetars no longer damage or pull other magnetars with either the aura or the active
- CLAW "Gyro", "Ringo" and "Dynamo" get about 6% cheaper

- increased the radar and sonar ranges of advanced radars and sonars by about 30-40% and adjusted their costs
- reduced the cost of air scouts by about 12%
- increased range and cost of AVEN "Trooper" and "Warrior" by about 10%
- slightly reduced CLAW "Pike" range from 1580 to 1500 and adjusted cost
- cloaked commanders had their decloak range increased from 100 to 170
- made units with relatively short range non-instant non-tracking projectiles slightly cheaper 
(this is a partial revert of a previous nerf which intended to hurt Double and Boar but affected AVEN's emg units as well)

- added 30 range to all weapons that use the "lasercannon" weapon type, which now also includes claw railguns and miniguns to work around an engine bug where they get up to 50 less range than intended
(this is what caused units such as AVEN magnum and some GEAR commanders to have uneven weapon ranges)

--- AI

- MFAI won't try to build on water (this caused issues on "island" maps with water edges)
- MFAI will make a few more metal extractors early and not use the commander to area patrol
 (revert of a recent change unintentionally made easy and normal AI too slow to expand and easy to beat)
- MFAI will likely self-destruct and respawn its commander if it gets stuck in a hole on maps like "Ravaged" for more than about 30s
- MFAI commander will try to chase its raiding group if it's stronger than it's regular attack group

--- UI / Visuals

- added "Artillery" to the description of several rocket and cannon turrets
- added "Very effective against air" tip to t2 missile turrets
- CLAW minigun and railgun weapons now have a more visible trail on their projectiles
(this required using a different weapon type)
- fixed GEAR land mines not showing damage on tooltip

(double click selects all of the same type within 1500 radius. It's disabled by default, but can be enabled on the F11 widgets menu)
- modified magnetars' glow to a more flickering animated form which looks better on slopes



2020/04/10 ------------------ NOTES v1.33 ----------------------

- fixed two lua errors that could occur during battles
(one was related to the comsat changes on last version and the other to burning units)


2020/04/07 ------------------ NOTES v1.32 ----------------------


--- Balance / Mechanics

ECONOMY
- reduced the HP of wreckages to 100% of the units original HP instead of 150%
- reduced the amount of metal wreckages have from 40% (25% for heaps) to 30% (15% for heaps)
- adv. metal extractors are about 30% more expensive
- exploiter metal extractors are about 50% more expensive and slightly more explosive (also a bit bigger visually)
- fusion reactors are about 5% cheaper but produce about 600 E/s instead of 800 E/s
(the wreckage yield reduction and late game economy nerfs are meant to encourage players to attack and damage the enemy economy and avoid saturation)

MISSILES
- increased the area of effect of level 2 fast missiles from 60 to 100 and reduced their range from 1450 to 1350 and ajusted costs
- also reduced the range by 100 on CLAW "Bishop" and SPHERE "Stresser" and adjusted costs
- slightly increased the dmg/s of level 2 fast missille turrets

- all l2 fast missile weapons with relatively high reload time now have overkill prevention to avoid wasting shots on light targets
(this also makes other turrets not try to fire at those targets)

FIGHTERS
- AVEN and GEAR level 2 fighters's missiles now have 630 range and 120 area of effect
- CLAW and SPHERE level 2 fighters' lasers now have 600+ range and they also have a secondary AA bomb with huge area of effect and a long reload time
- missiles and AA bombs from level 2 fighters will try to reacquire targets instead of flying in circles (most of the time)
(these changes made them significantly more expensive, but much effective against level 1 fighter swarms as long as they hit-n-run carefully)

LONG RANGE ROCKETS
- long range rocket platform cost increased to 3500m
- long range rockets now have much smaller explosions if they're shot down
(this also means that if launched in bursts they're much less likely to chain-explode if shot down)
- long range nuclear rockets had their area of effect reduced from 800 to 600 and damage from 10000 to 8000 and cost reduced from 4000m to 3000m
- long range rockets pierce through shields


SHIELDS
- increased the shield cap, regen rate and cost of SPHERE "Aegis" by 50% 
- increased the shield cap, regen rate of SPHERE "Shielder","Screener" and "Hermit" by 100% and cost by 60-100%
(this should lead to people requiring less shields to perform, which helps avoid performance issues)
- drastically reduced the max amount of shield points shared between large area shields from 10% of max per second to 2%
- large shields cannot absorb more than about 3-4x of their regeneration rate


MISC
- minor damage and HP upgrades add +6% instead of +5% each

- SPHERE "Slicer" will now prioritize aircraft if they're in range
- reduced range of SPHERE "Slammer" from 1350 to 1260 and adjusted cost (about 10% cheaper)

- increased range and cost on GEAR "Barrager" by about 5%
- increased cost of very long range plasma cannons and railgun by about 25%
- increased the cost of CLAW "Massacre" by about 10%
- increased the range and cost of CLAW "Dynamo" by 5%

- violent death explosions (Penetrator, Pike, etc.) deal M instead of H damage

- increased the turn rates of AVEN "Javelin" and "Turbulence" missile turrets by about 50%
- increased HP of AVEN Zephyr from 1800 to 3000 and cost from 1800M to 3000M
- increased AVEN "Tsunami" damage resistance when closed from 20 to 30%
- made AVEN "Tsunami" about 5% slower but slightly more maneuverable and its weapon has faster projectiles with bigger area of effect and energy cost and slightly less dmg/s
- increased AVEN "Swatter" dmg/s by 20% and cost by 10%
- increased AVEN "Excalibur" range from 1100 to 1300 and also drastically increased damage per shot, energy costs and slightly increased size, but made it about 15% slower and nearly 2x as expensive
- reduced range and projectile speed of AVEN "Skimmer" and made it about 15% cheaper


- GEAR "Firestorm" is about 20% slower, has 10% more HP and its missiles are now tracking, but had its cost increased by about 50%
(it's now also immune to burn)
- fire area effect duration on air increased from 2s to 5s

- increased brake rate for submarines
- made hovercraft and spinbots air-transportable if below the 3000 mass threshold

- made Comsat stations avoid wasting their turns when multiple stations from the same team are targetting the same location
(players can reveal one location permanently if they have 6 stations targetting it with "repeat" enabled)

- 5-10% cost reduction on dedicated anti-sub aircraft



COMMANDERS
- AVEN "Alpha" form commander now has -10% speed, +30% dmg/s and a M damage plasma bolt cannon instead of L damage EMG as secondary weapon
- AVEN "Zeta" form has the -10% range and 30% dmg/s on the lasers
- AVEN "Builder" form gets a very slight speed reduction and a light laser weapon instead of the EMG 
- rebalanced many commander forms to keep the consistency of the relative strength of surface vs underwater weapons and more accurately 
(this required lots of minor changes to a lot of commander forms, too many to name)

--- UI / Visuals

- tooltip shows a message with the transport weight class limit for air transports
- AVEN plasma bolt projectiles are a bit bigger to make them more threathening
- force player list widget to the bottom right corner
- Comsat action sound fades after just a few seconds to be less annoying

--- AI

- fix MFAI not reverting its builders to normal priority in some cases



2020/03/17 ------------------ NOTES v1.31 ----------------------


--- Balance / Mechanics

- fixed a major bug that could allow players to spawn multiple commanders

- reduced the amount of vertical range boost given to very short range cannons (< 380 range)
(this is to make fast level 1 units like wheelers, doubles and boars less able to hit air units)

- increased HP by up to 50% and reduced reload times by about 10-20% for level 2 heavy bomber aircraft and slightly increased costs (up to about +50%)
- increased HP by about 10-20% of fighter aircraft that use strafing attack runs and adjusted costs (+5-10%)
- increased flight altitude by about 10-15% for level1 and 2 fighter aircraft that use strafing attack runs
- very slightly increased the discount such strafing aircraft get from not being able to avoid closing range with their target (<3% effect on cost)
- slightly reduced the speed of non-strafing heavy bombers (5-10%)
- heavy bombers explode violently when destroyed (but AOE and damage is about half than what CLAW "Havoc" had on the previous version)
- reduced the range of GEAR "Stratos" weapons from 550 to 480 to lower the cost a bit (~15%)

- reduced range and cost of SPHERE "Gazer" by about 10%
(this brings them deeper into artillery range and closer to the range of other heavy fire support units so it's easier to hit)

- increased the footprint of CLAW "Halberd" and "Armadon" to prevent them from clumping when moving in groups
- made CLAW "Halberd" amphibious

- SPHERE "Gazer" form commander : 2.5% reduction in range and 5% reduced reload time on the laser weapon

- slightly reduced the projectile speed of very long range plasma cannons other than CLAW "Longhorn"


--- UI / Visuals

- CLAW level 2 aircraft plant now looks significantly different than the level 1 and also has a bigger footprint
- CLAW "Havoc" had its model slightly improved
- fixed some CLAW factories not emitting "glow" from their construction towers
- area shield generators should show info on tip about sharing and E drain
- updated the engine compatibility recommendation to "104.0.1-1464-g4f428c8 maintenance"


2020/03/08 ------------------ NOTES v1.30 ----------------------

--- Balance / Mechanics

- GEAR "Box" had dmg/s increased by 10% but drains 20 E/s to fire and had its cost reduced by 6%
- GEAR "Barrel" is about 10% slower and costs 80% more, but gets a secondary incendiary missile weapon

- AVEN commander cannon shots explode mid-air vs air targets

- AVEN "Bass" had its waves' area of effect doubled so it's much more effective against swarms of light units and aircraft
(the damage per tick was reduced but the overall damage each target takes should be about the same: 250 to 1250 L disruptor damage and a third as normal damage)

- commanders lose 10% of their experience whenever they're destroyed

- increased collision size for Hanz, Charger and Golem
- restored shielded units' collision volume adjustment to match the shield unless it's depleted
(this also makes shielded spheres easier to hit with artillery)

UNDERWATER
- made all torpedoes tracking, namely the ones shot from unmorphed commanders and l1 submarines
- increased Dmg/s of torpedo bomber aircraft (mostly through reductions in reload time), slightly reduced range to lower cost on SPHERE and GEAR torpedo bombers
- increased SPHERE "Clam" range from 500 to 630
- changed ground units' speed when they move underwater : they'll all slow down beyond a certain threshold (speed = 27), extra speed is halved. So a unit that'd move at 27 keeps its speed, while a unit with max speed = 54 will move at about 40 distance units/s. This means that the relative speed penalty is higher the faster the unit is (in practice relatively fast commanders will go from about 20% penalty to about 40% if they got full speed upgrades).
- increased footprint of submarines to avoid clumping and friendly fire when moving in groups
- reduced the inherent discout weapons with relatively slow but tracking projectiles get
- CLAW "Sinker" is now similar to AVEN and GEAR t1 torpedo launcher floating turrets
(the above changes also make the affected units cost about 10-40% more, excluding commanders)


AIR
- make AVEN, CLAW and SPHERE heavy bombers shoot in 360  and fly higher (they get slightly more expensive though)
- improved maneuverability of some aircraft, namely SPHERE "Moth" which had particularly less acceleration that similar aircraft

DRONES
- all drones are now relatively cheaper to build (discount increased from 30% to 50%)
- "Light drones" upgrade now costs 1000M but increases the limit to 3 drones instead of 2
- reduced the self-build times on light/medium drones from 4/12s to 2.5s/11s 
(fixed the self build times on light drones which were wrongly using the medium drone build times)


--- AI

- lowered the threshold for MFAI to morph its commander from 30m/300E to 20m/200E per second
- AI will no longer area-patrol with its commander unless it has factories nearby

--- Visuals

- modified the models and sounds of torpedo projectiles
- make resource multiplier show on the player's list next to the players' name
- made build points glow effect also show up when they're underwater
- modified firing sound of missiles from fighter aircraft





2020/02/23 ------------------ NOTES v1.29 ----------------------

- increased ranges of light laser towers and CLAW "Drill" from 520-550 to 560 and slightly increased their costs (up to 10%)

- CLAW "Thumper" : reduced range and cost by about 10%
(this means it no longer slightly outranges medium laser or missile towers which cost more than twice as much)
- CLAW "Nucleus" and "Mega" projectiles explode mid-air when targetting air units
- CLAW "Nucleus" can use high-trajectory mode

- AVEN and GEAR adv. torpedo launchers have their range reduced from 1500 to 1000 but have tracking torpedoes and a 20% cost reduction
- normalized max water depth for non-amphibious units at 35

- increased SPHERE "Tycho"'s acceleration and brake rates

- AVEN "Javelin" has a slightly bigger footprint and its missiles have a slightly higher trajectory to avoid hitting friendly units
- increased AOE of AVEN rapid disruptor projectiles from 48-64 to 96 and made them explode mid-air when used against aicraft 
(this makes them a bit more effective against air targets)
- reduced cost of units with disruptor projectiles by about 10% (the cost increase from the AOE increase compensates for this though)
- AVEN "Weaver" missiles follow a slightly higher trajectory to better avoid terrain obstructions
- AVEN "Stasis" cost and range reduced by 10%
- AVEN "Omega" form commander now has twin disruptor cannons instead of the secondary EMG weapon and has a shorter range torpedo launcher with higher dmg/s


- up to about 5% cost reduction for relatively expensive units
- reduced cost of units with weapons with large area of effect unless they have particularly long range
(this also makes GEAR "Grenados" significantly cheaper and buildings with large death explosions slightly more expensive)

- 7% fire rate increase on SPHERE "Nova" and GEAR "Infernal" commander forms

- 20% fire rate increase on SPHERE "Meteor" and AVEN "Icarus" heavy bombs, set range to 480 and adjusted cost (it ends up being about the same)

- 5% damage increase on GEAR "Blazer" form commander

- All-terrain units now have an 80  blind spot in a downward direction to avoid them firing through their body when targetting units on cliff tops from cliff sides
(this restriction should be barely noticeable and may be increased in the future)

- tough GEAR units with relatively short range fire attacks can no longer be set on fire (they still take direct and area fire damage, though)

MOVEMENT
- make units overlap and clump together less when moving but also be slightly less efficient at moving around
- make non all-terrain ground units slide down slopes they can't walk or drive through

2019/11/17 ------------------ NOTES v1.20 ----------------------

--- New units

- added "Scoper" aircraft for all factions : they target units or ground up to 1200 distance units away and reveal a 200 radius area around it
(the way it works allows it to be used to scout enemy positions on top of cliffs by targeting the cliff wall)


--- Balance / Mechanics

- AVEN "Kodiak" : allow it to fire the missiles without interfering with the aim of the main gun

- GEAR "Infernal" form commander : increased range of weapons by about 20% and decreased speed by 10%

--- Engine

- changed the recommended engine from "104.0.1-1327-g315b3fd maintenance" to "104.0.1-1382-gc0c48fc maintenance" or later
(lobby clients should auto-download the correct version after joining the nebula hosts on the official server)

- reduced the minimum water depth for medium and large ships from 25, 50 to 18, 30
- slightly reduced the targeting radius of submarines to avoid them being targeted by anti-surface weapons


- incendiary explosions that happen in the air trigger a mid-air fireball with 2s duration instead of the normal 20s on the ground
- GEAR "Destroyer" form commander was renamed to "Raider" and modified to have a dual flamethrower and vertically launched incendiary missile system
- GEAR "Infernal" form commander can now explode its fireballs mid-air
(this makes it a potentially dangerous against low gunship swarms, like the SPHERE "Nova" form)
- rebalanced fire AOE weapons : relatively fast-firing ones (Infernal form and Firestorm) got fire rate penalties and increased cost while slower firing ones got 5-10% cheaper

- CLAW "Dizzy" : reduced range by 10%, increased speed by 15% and fire rate by 60% and increased cost by 35%
(to make it crazier and differentiate it more from the other spinbots)

- fixed a potential scouting exploit with the area-metal-extractor commands

- fixed range upgrades not updating the dynamic damage drop with distance

- modified how aiming is done on some robots with different weapons on each arm to prevent conflicts



--- Sounds / Animations

- GEAR "Harasser" now properly turns it's barrel sleeve vertically when aiming 
(note that this didn't prevent it from firing)

- modified the sounds for light plasma cannons and small incendiary explosions

- removed annoying looping sound when mobile radar jammers and intelligence drones are guarding other mobile units


--- UI

- added ON/OFF button to radar/sonar ships

- 10s after the game ends, a 30s countdown timer starts and when it ends the game exits automatically


2018/12/18 ------------------ NOTES v1.05 ----------------------

- increased AVEN "Kit" HP and DPS by 25% and speed by about 7% and increased cost by 30%

- automatically reset orders for construction towers if they're targetting outside their build range
- adjusted the name of torpedo weapons for consistency : "Torpedoes" and "Unguided Torpedoes"
- fixed clearing of map markers and drawings every few seconds which shouldn't happen (leftover from AI debug)

- settings widget enforce 10k nanoparticles limit and sets mouse scroll wheel speed to -25
(the latter should prevent new players from bumping into the annoying inverted mousewheel zoom issue)

- fixed invisible hull sections on GEAR "Executioner" and "Jigsaw" ships and added thruster tubes on all ship models
- GEAR "Jigsaw" back turret raises significantly higher as the laser can shoot over the front turret

- increased icon size for level2 factories
- reduced icon size for construction towers
- added icons for magnetar, radars and radar jammers

- fixed expenditure labels and values on the resource bars

- made ruby and obsidian lightning beams more intense visually

2018/11/30 ------------------ NOTES v1.03 ----------------------

--- balance / mechanics

- reduced the dmg/s of CLAW "Slayer form" commander's torpedo by about 20%

--- AI

- easy and normal AI should grow a bit slower but be harder to rush and use the commander better when base is under attack

--- UI

- fixed an error that could appear sometimes when right-click-dragging to draw line formation


2018/11/26 ------------------ NOTES v1.02 ----------------------

--- balance / mechanics

- SPHERE "Chroma" and "Comet" flying spheres explode more violently when killed
- AVEN "Bolter" now shoots in 6 round bursts instead of 2 round bursts, but reload time is tripled and cost increased by 7%
- fixed "rare" issue where long range missiles could become untargetable and explode both on the platform and on the target

--- AI

- make AI less likely to get stuck without making level1 and level2 factories



2018/11/22 ------------------ NOTES v1.01 ----------------------


--- new units

- added AVEN "Perceptor" : Intelligence hovercraft. Provides radar, sonar and radar jammer


--- balance / mechanics

- Fixed GEAR energy storage not being able to be built underwater
- increased the terrain slope tolerance and reduced the death blast damage of AVEN "Runner" to match the other small robots
- AVEN "Knight" has move state set to "hold position" by default
- increased the movement footprint for a many small and medium robots so they'll clump together less when moving in groups
- removed the 2x vertical range bonus on short range flamethrowers (GEAR) and laser cutter weapons (CLAW)
- CLAW "Slayer" form commander gets 10% increased speed and 10% reduced range
- CLAW "Sword" : reduced laser cutter range by 10%
(this means flamethrower and laser cutter units can no longer hit air in most situations)

--- AI

- more likely to build energy generators in general to try to achieve a higher energy surplus 
- more likely to build wind generators
- fixed AI not building geothermal generators
- fixed issue with MFAI assigning too many builders to dedicated roles and not leaving any to build level2 factories back in base
- fixed AI skipping level2 factories unless it had significant surplus energy and full stores
- AI builds radar and radar jammer units from the advanced factories earlier and is more likely to rebuild them if they're destroyed
- more likely to build artillery units against enemies who make lots of static defenses
- AI builders tasked with building metal extractors now build defenses and radars nearby instead of spending time moving around
- fixed check for idle builders to avoid them getting stuck
- less likely to move relatively fast units from the main party to the raiding party if unable to attack (requires much longer periods where it's unable to do so)
- normal MFAI is slightly more conservative when attacking (will try to grow its numbers further before doing so)

--- UI/visuals

- change dust particles from small and medium explosions to be more noticeable while keeping them finer for large explosions
- modified the chat widget to avoid breaking words when splitting text to lines
- modified AVEN Bolter's model to make it look less blocky and reflect its light armored status



2018/10/18 ------------------ NOTES v1.000 ----------------------


--- new units

- added long range rocket platforms for all factions (level 2), which can hold up to 4 rockets each
- the rockets have relatively low HP and L armor type and can be shot down by enemy weapons which target fast units and aircraft effectively and have good range
- the rockets' range covers the whole map

New rocket types:
- Nuclear Missile: expensive missile that will likely kill all units on a large radius unless it's shot down while still far from target
- Destruction/Construction "DC" Missile: can kill small clusters of units, provides temporary vision and spawns a construction tower on impact

(these are identical for all factions : faction-specific ones may be added at a later date)


--- balance / mechanics

GENERAL
- fortification walls have H armor instead of M

- comsat stations reveal the targeted area for 30s instead of 15s
- fixed issue with comsat beacons being targetable and blocking projectiles

- made relatively slow units and defenses and units with relatively high HP/cost up to 10% cheaper
- made relatively fast units or units with relatively powerful and long-ranged weapons up to 10% more expensive

- reduced the death explosion damage and area of effect for most level 1 ground units

- removed experience gain by dealing the killing blow to enemy units
(this means that having the HP bar drained by enemy fire is now worth 50% as much experience as killing an enemy of equal value instead of 25%)

- removed obscure flanking mechanic unless specifically stated
(units took up to twice as much damage when being hit from different directions)

- increased the HP and speed of level 1 light tanks by about 10% and adjusted the cost

- GEAR "Canister" and "Eruptor" are set to hold position by default
- GEAR "Infernal" form commander got about 5% less direct weapon damage on the fireball cannon and 5% increased range on the torpedo weapon
- replaced GEAR "Crock" with "Rhino" : Amphibious assault gun with 33% front-back dmg resistance bonus/penalty a forward-only cannon and a secondary laser turret
- CLAW "Assassin" form commander got about 5% less range, reduced HP by 100 and 25% higher reload time on its torpedo weapon
- CLAW "Longhorn" : increase model height to compensate for its flatter trajectory
- SPHERE "Emerald" form commander got 5% more movement speed but 9% reduced range and reduced energy cost to fire from 160 to 120 E/s
- SPHERE "Nova" form commander got 10% increased range
- SPHERE "Ruby" form commander got 15% reduced energy cost to fire
- increased the HP of SPHERE "Rock" and "Slicer" by about 10% and adjusted the cost

MISSILES/AA
- increase damage and reload time for light missiles by about 20-40%
- make large fast missiles L damage instead of M and reduce the area of effect (from 80-120 to 60)
- reduced range by 200 on static launchers, increased turret turn rates and reduced pop-up delay and reduced the unit costs significantly
(this increases the effectiveness against light units and aircraft, including long range rockets, relative to against medium/heavy armored units)
- missiles have cylinder targeting with 2x range altitude limit and fly a bit faster
(so they're also better at shooting down long range rockets)
- CLAW "Hyper" is a bit taller when open and also slightly improved the model


UPGRADES
- changed minor regen upgrade to give 1 + 0.1%HP per second instead of 2 HP/s
- increased flat regen on major regen upgrade from +2 to +3 HP/s


--- UI / Visuals

- Made lasers thicker to make them shinier
- SPHERE "Opal" beams and forms have been renamed to "Emerald"
- big explosions shake the camera
- used a rounder model (more faces) for SPHERE "Chroma" and "Magnetar"
- moving mouse to the upper part of the screen will show a less intrusive "press space to view chat" hint instead of showing the chat
- GEAR "Heater" tank has a longer and narrower body to differentiate it more from the "squarer" slower tanks

--- AI
- SPHERE AI will make more long range missile towers instead of static sphere towers
- AI moves attacking groups more decisively when targeting undefended clusters of enemies
- fixed AI definition of number of builders by task type


2018/08/19 ------------------ NOTES v0.999 ----------------------

- fixed MFAI sometimes morphing its commander immediately when the game starts


2018/08/19 ------------------ NOTES v0.998 ----------------------

- fixed walls providing sight like other player-owned buildings


2018/08/19 ------------------ NOTES v0.997 ----------------------


--- balance / mechanics

GENERAL
- roughly doubled the speed of blast waves from explosions
- self-damage in general is reduced to 33% of the original value
- Large Fusion reactors explosion radius increased from 275 to 325 and damage from 2000 to 2500 and get a 5% cost reduction
- increased the cost of GEAR "Big Bob" by about 50% and removed the high-trajectory mode
(was unusually low due an error on the balancing algorithm related to having high trajectory option and two weapons - oops)
- fixed an issue with aircraft debris "shaking" on the ground
- fixed heat-rays not having the stated 30% damage drop over range
(the auto-balancer wasn't fooled so now the units get about 10% cheaper as a result)

SHIELDS
- large area shields regenerate faster by draining up to 10% (1% from small shields) of maximum shield charge per second from shields within its radius
- shields are only shared above half the maximum charge

WALLS
- increased the cost slightly and build/repair time by about 10% for fortification wall sections
- changed the armor type from L to M but reduced the hit points from 4800 to 2500
- walls no longer change to "features" when built, so they can be repaired
(this also makes it easier for your units to use own walls as cover as they won't attempt to fire through)

COMMANDERS
- added Sphere "Nova Form" commander : slow but heavily armored. Weapon has huge area of effect and can shoot in high-trajectory mode.
- GEAR "Infernal Form" commander has high-trajectory mode
(it can shoot its fireballs uphill and over walls)

AIRCRAFT / SPHERES
- AVEN "Twister" now has "L" damage emg/laser combo (better vs light units and air)
- AVEN "Tornado" made a bit slower, tougher and has "M" damage rockets
- SPHERE sphere factory can build air transports
- SPHERE flying spheres are generally set to hold position to avoid wasting energy
- modified way that energy cost when moving is calculated for the flying spheres to avoid draining the full amount when repositioning vertically while idle
- advanced construction drones are now automatically set to "high priority"
- doubled maneuverability of scout aircraft
- aircraft flying way off the map are "teleported" back to a spot on the nearest corner
(workaround for a Spring engine bug)

UPGRADES
- increased the general limit of commander upgrades from 2 to 3
- increased the cost of hp, range, damage and speed commander upgrades from 500 M to 750 M, but increased own limits from 1 to 2
- increased own limits on commander regen and drone upgrades from 1 to 3


--- UI

- changed the default side from "AVEN" to "RANDOM"

- moving mouse over chat box position if it's no longer visible shows it and scrolls to latest message
- 15s after the latest "scroll up", automatically scrolls down to the latest message

- show a warning message if the Spring engine version is different from the recommended (currently 104.0)
- show a warning message if game starts without any opponent and disable victory conditions
- show a warning message if game starts with unsupported AI players instead of MFAI

- show a warning overlay whenever the commander is damaged while out of view of the player

- fixed an issue with resource drain wrongly rounded to integer on the tooltip
- moving mouse over orders menu buttons shows default hotkey information in most cases
- do not assign "perfect" efficiency award when players resign early before any units are killed


--- AI / MFAI

- builds scout pad and uses air scouts
- improved targetting for attacking forces to be more sensitive to the direction of threats and allied units
- added ability to detach a ground raiding party which will try to sneak around enemy defenses and hit vulnerable targets
(fast ground units are assigned to it by default)
- the attack aircraft group also behaves like a raiding party and will try to sneak around defended areas
- more likely to target metal extractors and construction units in general
- set long range units to hold position to avoid them chasing fleeing targets into range of enemy fire
- construction units are less likely to run into enemies when trying to build metal extractors
- use offsets when processing game state,etc. for multiple AI instances to spread the load across multiple frames and avoid "hickups"
- reduced the amount of free metal and energy income the brutal AI gets (50 to 35 M/s) and the scaling over time
- attack aircraft group takes into account enemies which are bad anti-air when considering where to attack
- normal MFAI builds the first factory earlier so it grows faster
- avoids building factories on places which do not have a soft-sloped land connection to the base center


2018/05/27 ------------------ NOTES v0.996 ----------------------

--- balance / mechanics

- units with weapons with an AOE edge effectiveness boosts got a bit cheaper 
(5-10% cost reduction on GEAR Grenado, CLAW Nucleus, Massacre and Mega, and AVEN Stasis and Tsunami)
 

ECONOMY
- increased the base economy from 6 M/s and 60 E/s to 8 M/s and 80 E/s
(this is meant to give a bit more slack for players who want to do something other than rushing expansion)

- reduced energy cost of repairing damage from 100% to 75% of the unit's energy cost


AIRCRAFT
- air transports fly higher and change altitude faster

- SPHERE flying spheres now use the smoothed air mesh to avoid bumping into cliffs

- air mesh should follow the ground height profile more closely
(this means on maps with high hills aircraft will not climb so high unless they're closer to the cliffs)

- aircraft no longer try to fly below the altitude of the lowest metal spot 
(relevant for maps where disputed ground is on high plateaus delimited by steep cliffs)

--- UI / visuals

- tooltip over empty ground shows altitude instead of ground speed modifier (was always x1)



2018/04/26 ------------------ NOTES v0.995 ----------------------


- fixed warnings that showed up when building SPHERE geothermal powerplant 

- fix issue with name not appearing over AI players' commanders

- fixed issue which caused flying spheres and some aircraft to move weirdly due to collisions with the factory after construction finishes

- improved wreckage of SPHERE "Trax" and GEAR "Box"

--- new units

- AVEN "Tsunami" : Heavy Riot Hovercraft

- GEAR "Luminator" : Long Range Heavy Fire Support Robot
- GEAR "Land Mine" : perimeter defense

- CLAW "Dynamo" : Mobile Anti-Armor Energy Ring Launcher
(charges and shoots a very powerful ring that can pierce through multiple enemies, but charging can be interrupted by enemy fire)


--- balance / mechanics

- AVEN "Bass" : reload time and damage halved, to make it more consistent. It's projectiles now show a cool space distortion effect
- AVEN "Excalibur" : reduced HP by 25% and cost by 12%. Modified model to look "slimmer"
- AVEN "Swatter" : reduced HP by 25%, changed armor type from L to M and adjusted cost

- GEAR "Flareon": turret rotates to keep firing direction to compensate for the body rotation, if necessary

- CLAW "Gyro" charge disruption threshold lowered to 25% damage taken within 3 seconds instead of 1 second

- SPHERE "Magnetar" : increase passive regeneration from 160HP/s to 250HP/s

- Commander regeneration upgrade adds +20HP/s instead of 15HP/s


--- UI / visuals

2018/02/11 ------------------ NOTES v0.993 ----------------------

--- balance / mechanics

- increased AVEN "Defender" damage per second by 45% and increased cost by 20%

- changed AVEN and GEAR level 2 fighters to shoot a pair of faster missiles with slightly higher burst damage but less range
- increased HP of level 2 fighters (except SPHERE) by 100 (10-15%) and adjusted the costs
- slightly increased the projectile speed and reduced the range of fighter aircraft
- increased strafing fighter aircraft's acceleration
(these changes make strafing aircraft more cost-effective at fighting other aircraft in general, namely hovering aircraft which can shoot back efficiently)

- modified GEAR "Firestorm" to use incendiary rockets instead of fireball cannons


--- UI

- commands for building or upgrading metal extractors in an area now show up immediately when shift-queued




2018/01/31 ------------------ NOTES v0.992 ----------------------


--- new units

- added COMSAT station for all factions : a somewhat expensive building that can reveal an area of the map for 15s every three minutes
(these are an alternative investment to having to recurrently suicide swarms of air scouts to reveal areas behind enemy defenses)


--- balance / mechanics

- when a unit is ordered to attack a target and then ordered to move, it should keep attacking the previous target while in range

- improved the lua metal spot handler so that the metal decals are perfectly centered and more visible when resource highlight view is enabled

- removed global resource multipliers and other game options as some weren't processed properly
(they may be changed/restored at a later date)

- fixed a bug which prevented commanders from capturing enemy units, but sharply reduced the capture speed to 2/3 of the normal build speed
- "Builder Form" commanders have their capture speeds and terraform speeds set to 2x the normal amounts (same as their build speed)

- slightly increased the extraction radius of advanced metal extractors to ensure that no metal income is lost if they're built beside an existing basic extractor


--- UI

- updated the name and descriptions of metal extractors, now extraction rate multiplier and energy drain is shown on the tooltip

- added buttons that allow building the various metal extractor forms in an area : basic (level1), safe and hazardous (level2)
. these replaced the metal extractor area-upgrade and upgrade state buttons
. constructors will build the level2 forms beside existing level1 forms instead of reclaiming them first

- disable game speed indicator when the game starts to avoid overlapping clock/fps indicator 





2017/12/24 ------------------ NOTES v0.991 ----------------------

- fixed MAJOR bug introduced on the previous version which caused some units to become stuck on factories and others to not be buildable at all!

--- balance / mechanics

- increased AVEN "Omega Form" commander's HP by 100

- increased scout aircraft HP from 90 to 110 and cost by 10%

- added CLAW "Tempest" : Heavy Missile Skirmisher Spinbot   (reworked unit from the adv. shipyard)
- added CLAW "Haze" : Intelligence Spinbot



--- balance / mechanics


GENERAL BALANCE

- increased repair energy cost from 90% to 100% of the unit's energy cost

- removed aircraft-specific cost modifiers : they now cost about 7% more metal but about half as much energy
(they now have their energy cost set to 5x the amount of their metal cost instead of x10, like ground units and buildings)

- increased the efficiency assumption for relatively fast non-tracking projectiles, which makes some units with cannons relatively more expensive

- slightly reduced projectile velocities (10-20%) for many plasma cannons
 
- made lower weight units about 5% cheaper than bigger more expensive ones
- made units with very low HP about 5% relatively cheaper
- made units with below average range up to about 5% cheaper than longer ranged units
- made slower units and static defenses up to about 5% cheaper than faster units
- reduced cost of units which cost more 3k metal (they may still be more expensive due to the previous nerfs)
(these make most level1 units cheaper relative to level2 units, which get 5 to 25% more expensive than in the previous version)

- increased cost of level 2 air transports by about 10%

- reduced idle HP regeneration per second from 2+0.3%HP to 2+0.2%HP

- fixed collision volumes for static long range plasma cannons

- the reload rate on commanders' weapons is reduced to 25% while building
(this is to reduce the advantage commanders with high reload time weapons have when building and fighting near the front line)

- made most heavy tanks amphibious 

- reduced cost of amphibious boats by 15%
 (they get the same "discount" as other ships as they still have the 33% speed penalty on land)

- unit mass now calculated to also scale with unit hp instead of metal cost, and air units are lighter
(this affects transportability and impulse from being hit)

- changed mass limit for level1 air transports from 1000 to 1200

- made heavy units push-resistant


SPECIFIC UNIT CHANGES

- increased the DPS level 1 land scout units by about 20%

- increased the size, HP of battleships and main gun DPS by about 20%, but reduced their speed by about 40%

- added angle restriction on secondary weapon on GEAR "Proteus" and CLAW "Wrecker" so the front turrets don't shoot "through" the larger back turret

- AVEN "Gryphon" rockets no longer track their targets
- reduced speed of AVEN "Excalibur" by 10%
- doubled AVEN "Skimmer" DPS
- increased AVEN "Turbulence" DPS on missile launcher by 50% but slightly reduced range and dps on the secondary lasers

- increased HP of GEAR "Cube" robots by 400
- GEAR "Might" is now about 20% slower but 20% stronger in HP and DPS
- GEAR Cube and Titan robots are now amphibious
- GEAR "Barrel" no longer slows down on water

- made CLAW "Crawler" bigger and stronger (+20% DPS, +30% HP + 15% range)
- changed CLAW "Cutter"'s torpedo to an amphibious rocket and the laser gets +10% range but deals M damage instead of H
- changed CLAW "Trident"'s amphibious rockets : they hit a bit harder and stray less, but with longer reload time and slower speed
- changed CLAW "Sword"'s weapon from cannon to a short range high DPS laser cutter

- SPHERE "Magnetar" now regenerates 100HP/s and has radar jammer and a toggleable aura that pulls deals up to 150(L) disruptor dmg/s within 300 range, but doubled the reload time on the disruptor blast and increased cost by 20%
- reduced speed of SPHERE "Chub" by 10%
- SHPERE construction sphere regenerates 30 HP/s
- reduced E cost to move for SPHERE construction sphere, Astra and Gazer from 150 to 120 E/s
- SPHERE sphere factory can build level 1 construction aircraft


--- MAPS

- added preliminary support for some maps which have no hard-coded ground metal values but have lua metal spot configuration 

--- AI

- MFAI will use AVEN Hovercraft, CLAW Spinbots and SPHERE flying spheres
- SPHERE MFAI now builds hardened fission reactors

--- UI

- tooltip shows mass and transportability "light", "heavy" or "no transport" status for mobile units
- groups of units will try to converge near the point when given non-unit point targets as the auto-formation wasn't working properly
(it's generally recommended to click-drag when giving orders so units spread out along the lines)


--- effects / visuals

- fully charged magnetars light up the grow below, slightly
- renamed GEAR air transports from "Valkyrie" to "Carrier" to match their more "industrial" flavour
- fixed glowy effects from underwater explosions being drawn above the water surface (workaround for Spring 104.0 engine bug)

--- engine

- changed SpringRTS engine version compatiblity and requirement from 103.0 to 104.0

--- new units

- added SPHERE hardened fission reactors
(this adds a choice between the previous cheaper but vulnerable economy clusters or sturdy ones)

--- balance / mechanics

MOVEMENT
- enabled "raw movement" (requires springRTS engine 104.0)
(this means units are more likely to travel in a straight line over short distances if they can)

COMMANDERS
- improved overall combat attributes of most AVEN, GEAR and CLAW commanders by about 10-15%
(they're no longer being overvalued relative to SPHERE commanders due to their cloaking ability)
- improved the relative balance between the underwater and surface weapons (underwater weapon is generally worth half as much on all commanders)
- reduced range by 6%, increased DPS by 12% but doubled the energy consumption for the unmorphed SPHERE commander's beam
- fixed issues when trying to aim the torpedo weapon while underwater (affected several AVEN and GEAR commanders)

CLOAKABLE UNITS
- made cloakable units about 8% cheaper

CONSTRUCTION UNITS
- removed 0.1m/s and 0.2m/s and 50/100 resource storage from construction units and reduced the costs by roughly 10%

- reduced construction aircraft movement speed by 20% but increased their HP by about 20%
(they're still fragile)
- increased build power of construction drones by 25%
- increased the build time for most level 2 buildings by 37% to have the resource drain consistent with the other buildings

OTHER
- fixed aiming delays that made most fast firing weapons (emg, miniguns, continuous beams) deal 10-20% less damage per second than expected
(this happened while maneuvering or against mobile targets even if they were still within tolerance)
- fixed units with torpedoes trying to target enemy aircraft

- reduced CLAW "Grinder" dps and range by about 10% and cost by about 25%
- made CLAW "Mega" significantly bigger and stronger and adjusted the cost
- made GEAR "Cascade" bigger and increased the damage per pass, but now it deals M damage instead of H and is slightly slower and adjusted the cost
(a single bomber is now much more likely to be able to destroy a single factory or small cluster in one pass and survive) 
- increased GEAR "Instigator" HP from 850 to 1000 and cost slightly and changed the armor type from L to M
- increased SPHERE "Crustle" HP from 1100 to 1200 and adjusted the cost (+6%)

- "Advanced Plating" upgrade changed from +8% to +10% HP

--- UI

(note that level1 factories are built 50% faster and aircraft have a builtin cost modifier of 7% less metal but 100% more energy to build/repair)



2017/09/17 ------------------ NOTES v0.986 ----------------------

- fixed bug where GEAR's scout pad couldn't build air scouts (oops)

2017/09/17 ------------------ NOTES v0.985 ----------------------

(didn't happen when using springlobby, though)


2017/09/17 ------------------ NOTES v0.984 ----------------------

--- new units

- added scout pads for all factions : cheap level 1 buildings that build air scouts
(this is to discourage some rushes and early blind rock-paper-scissors gameplay)

--- balance / mechanics

- significantly increased acceleration of SPHERE "Bit" robots
- fixed SPHERE "Golem" missiles being launched horizontally
- increased damage per shot and reload time by about 20% for most missiles (damage per second is the same)

COMMANDER DRONES

- commander drones are now automatically destroyed if they somehow stray too far from the commander (twice as far as the retreat range, or about 1200)
- intelligence drones got even cheaper and drain 75 instead of 90 E/s but radar/sonar range was reduced from 1300/1100 to 1100/900
- light drones evened out across factions, weapon's base DPS was set to 50 (up from 35 and 44 DPS)
- medium drones changed: AVEN's a bit faster and deals more damage at shorter range, SPHERE's tougher but slower and got its weapon range slightly reduced

RESOURCES
- reduced relative metal extraction multiplier for moho mines and exploiters from x3 to x2.5
- metal extractors and moho mines are now about 20% more expensive
- made metal extractors a bit tougher (from 300-500HP to 450-580HP)
- exploiters extract the same amount of metal as moho mines (was 93%) but increased energy drain from 80/s to 90/s
(this is meant to increase the payback times of rushing resource production, make exploiters more attractive and reward raiding more)
- removed energy income/cost from units that produce or drain less than 3 metal/s when moving

WRECKAGES
- units with build percentage greater than 50% explode normally and leave wreckage when destroyed
- prevent nano-frames from using self-destruct
- death explosions for most non-hazardous units and buildings deal L, M damage type instead of M, H

gui_hlight_unit.lua
unit_stockpile.lua
unit_z_selector.lua
gui_greensquares_v3.lua
camera_smooth_move.lua



------------------ NOTES v0.2 ----------------------


--- unit changes
- miscellaneous tweaks to several units
- units that explode violently on death are now cheaper overall (for example SPHERE's level1 small fusion reactor)

- added ARM "Stasis" : level 3 EMP Cannon
- added SPHERE "Stout" : level 2 Armored Gun Turret
- added SPHERE "Rain Maker" : level 2 Shielded All-terrain Radar Jammer/Missile Kbot
- added SPHERE "Tick" : level 2 All-terrain Assault Kbot


--- widgets / GUI
- added simple and advanced player list widgets
- updated commanders name tags widget (names were missing)
- added commander selection widget (ctrl+c wasn't working)






------------------ NOTES v0.1 ----------------------

- it has most land, air and some sea units for CLAW and SPHERE

- each commander has 3 distinct upgrade paths, depending on whether you want to improve mobility, durability or range (does not improve resource generation or build power).

- has new units for arm and core as well, some of the existing units were reworked, some (maverick, annihilator, doomsday, etc.) were given new 3do models

- metal makers have been disabled, but all commanders give +4 M/s

- economy scales smoothly, moho mines provide about 3 times as much metal as mexes, for 60 E/s

- commanders can be respawned in commander respawners (which can be built by any constructor). Respawning costs 1000M and 10000E and takes about 30s (can't be assisted). Experience is saved, but not upgrades (need another 30s and +1500M, 10000E to upgrade)

- for now, it has no mine-layers, no nukes, and no vulcans (does have berthas though)

- all ground units have 600 LOS and aircraft have 720 LOS (there is no distinct radar and sonar LOS) (has LOS widget)

- not compatible with any AI, for now

- it has a special tooltip widget that shows the armor type and hitpower types of the unit's weapons

- has team color widget that makes the player blue, allies teal, enemies red

--- ARMOR vs HITPOWER
- Light (L)       (takes full dmg from all sources)
- Medium (M)    (takes half dmg from light hitpower weapons)
- Heavy (H)    (takes half dmg from medium hitpower weapons and quarter dmg from light hitpower weapons)

(throwing a mass of flashes or scout ships against medium and heavy armored units should fail miserably)

- SPHERE's unit shields protect only the owner, take 2x dmg from paralyzer weapons, and regenerate 2%hp/s at the cost of 4%hp E/s
(they take dmg according to the unit's armor type, for now)
