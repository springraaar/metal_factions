2020/01/10 ------------------ NOTES v1.25 ----------------------

--- New units

- added SPHERE "Double" : level1 Raider Vehicle

- added CLAW "Ringo" : level1 Raider/Skirmisher Robot equipped with an energy ring launcher


--- Balance / Mechanics

- increased GEAR "Kano" range and cost by about 15%
- GEAR light plant can now build "Igniter" incendiary raider vehicles
- renamed GEAR "Raider" to "Assaulter" and increased its speed by about 6% and cost by about 3%

- increased CLAW "Knife" HP by 16% and cost by 8%

- SPHERE "Gaunt" : increased damage per shot and reload time but decreased dmg/s by about 10%, speed reduced by 16%, cost reduced by about 10%
- SPHERE light plant can now build "Gaunt" 

- further general cost change of up to about -5% to +5% penalizing relatively strong or long-ranged units (mostly level2)
(short ranged level1 units should be relatively cheaper now compared to the other options - this is applied on top of the previous cost changes)

--- Sounds

- modified sounds for some of AVEN and SPHERE light vehicles
- modified sounds of some large explosions to differentiate them from long range plasma cannon explosions

--- AI / MFAI

- modified AI to use the new build options
- AI Light factories will sometimes build a set of half a dozen raiders and then restore the normal queue



2019/12/28 ------------------ NOTES v1.24 ----------------------

- fixed chat type button overlapping the players list when spectators are present

- removed debug messages indicating that AI start position was selected successfully



2019/12/25 ------------------ NOTES v1.23 ----------------------


--- Balance / Mechanics

- on team games, players are no longer set to "dead" even if they lost all units as long as allies are still standing
(this is to allow the other teammates to give a them a commander pad and get back into the game)

MOVEMENT
- make units overlap and clump together less when moving but also be slightly less efficient at moving around
- make non all-terrain ground units slide down slopes they can't walk or drive through
- relatively fast units will generally make sharper turns and bump into terrain or get stuck less, but also lose some speed while turning

--- UI

- fixed icon for commander respawners
- when single units are selected or mouse is over them, show owner name on the bottom-left tooltip
- fixed ctrl-c focusing on but not selecting the commander
- added button to change the chat type above the players list

--- AI / MFAI

- AI will ignore walls 
(sometimes its raider or aircraft groups would get distracted by a lone wall section somewhere on the map)
- fix AI not choosing start locations properly on some maps




2019/12/08 ------------------ NOTES v1.22 ----------------------

--- Balance / Mechanics

- modified SPHERE "Magnetar" :
. increased damage, area of effect and pull strength of the aura, but increased cost by 20%
. the pull aura is now much more effective at catching medium and heavy units
. aura drains 200 E/s when active
. it's now disabled by default to avoid damaging your own units after getting out of the factory
. updated radar icon

- fixed lua error that sometimes happened when scoper aircraft were destroyed

- increased collision volume size for AVEN "Dazer" and "Stasis"


--- UI

- tooltip shows that units that deal paralyze damage also deal 33% normal damage
- tooltip shows E cost per shot for weapons with reload time > 5s

--- Visuals

- modified AVEN "Zephyr" aura effects to be teal instead of green




2019/11/18 ------------------ NOTES v1.21 ----------------------

(one would trigger auto-resign and the other would mess with the damage and cloak handler)


2019/11/17 ------------------ NOTES v1.20 ----------------------

--- New units

- added "Scoper" aircraft for all factions : they target units or ground up to 1200 distance units away and reveal a 200 radius area around it
(the way it works allows it to be used to scout enemy positions on top of cliffs by targeting the cliff wall)


--- Balance / Mechanics

- AVEN "Kodiak" : allow it to fire the missiles without interfering with the aim of the main gun

- GEAR "Infernal" form commander : increased range of weapons by about 20% and decreased speed by 10%
- GEAR "Marauder" : increased range by 10%, reduced fire rate by 7% and adjusted cost
(modified model to slightly increase the height of the firing position)
- GEAR "Thud" : made it a bit stronger, with 20% increased range, improved accuracy and dps and adjusted cost (+30%)

- CLAW "Roller" : increased range and cost by about 20%

--- AI / MFAI

- increased GEAR "Thud"'s dmg/s by about 20% and cost by about 10%


--- UI / Other

 (it was too similar to missile explosions, but this may be changed in the future)

- made flying sphere map icons a bit bigger

- fixed errors that appeared ocasionally when issuing area-metal-extractor commands




2019/10/06 ------------------ NOTES v1.17 ----------------------


--- Balance / Mechanics

- about 2% cost reduction in units with bursty L damage weapons and relatively low dmg/s, namely light missile launchers
(as a side effect there's also a slight reduction on cost of buildings that explode violently when destroyed)

- fixed AVEN "Turbulence" not firing from the main rocket turret (oops)

- fixed AVEN "Bass" firing too early (before reaching the proper aim alignment)

- fixed AVEN "Ghost" decloaking while flying over water

- CLAW "Flail" now has two shotguns instead of shotgun/cannon. Slightly increased is range and energy cost to fire.
- AVEN "Stalker" side missile launchers are replaced with higher dps light lasers with same range as the main weapon.
(these help make the units role clearer and avoid aiming issues)

- SPHERE "Moth" has slightly improved maneuverability, dmg/s, aiming tolerance and projectile turn rate but reduced projectile speed
(it should be much less likely to miss nearby targets)


--- Sounds

- made unit selection and movement sounds more noticeable (they've been too muted on the latest versions unless the player zooms in)
(use +/- to adjust global volume ingame)
- added distinctive sounds for CLAW and SPHERE robots and commanders

--- UI

- adjusted icon for GEAR "Heater" and "Cube" robots, AVEN "Albatross", Zephyr and various radar/jammer units

(to avoid people with default values not seeing icons or having visually distorted map height profile when zooming out)

--- Animations / Visuals

- slightly improved textures on several CLAW robots


2019/09/01 ------------------ NOTES v1.15 ----------------------

--- Engine

- changed the recommended engine from "104.0.1-1327-g315b3fd maintenance" to "104.0.1-1382-gc0c48fc maintenance" or later

- slightly increased the turnrate of relatively fast vehicles to avoid pathing issues
- most smaller units can no longer crush trees

- allow depth charges to hit hovercraft

- removed "hit n run" button from construction aircraft
- prevent air transports from lowering into "void" hazard areas on some maps, killing the transported unit as it got below the threshold

- fixed issue of long range rockets getting attached to the wrong pad on long range rocket platforms

- respawned commanders are set to the move state they had when they were previously destroyed

(models and textures by Beherith, same as used on ZK)

- modified sound when firing torpedo weapons and some of the light lasers

- made feature crush sound less annoying and fade out with distance




2019/03/09 ------------------ NOTES v1.061 ----------------------

- fixed SPHERE "Shine" wreck error (typo on the previous version)

- modified AVEN "Ghost" bombs' trajectory to avoid it missing nearby targets



2019/03/05 ------------------ NOTES v1.06 ----------------------

- GEAR "Destroyer" form commander was renamed to "Raider" and modified to have a dual flamethrower and vertically launched incendiary missile system
- GEAR "Infernal" form commander can now explode its fireballs mid-air
(this makes it a potentially dangerous against low gunship swarms, like the SPHERE "Nova" form)
- rebalanced fire AOE weapons : relatively fast-firing ones (Infernal form and Firestorm) got fire rate penalties and increased cost while slower firing ones got 5-10% cheaper

- CLAW "Dizzy" : reduced range by 10%, increased speed by 15% and fire rate by 60% and increased cost by 35%
(to make it crazier and differentiate it more from the other spinbots)

- added ON/OFF button to radar/sonar ships

- 10s after the game ends, a 30s countdown timer starts and when it ends the game exits automatically


2018/12/18 ------------------ NOTES v1.05 ----------------------

- increased AVEN "Kit" HP and DPS by 25% and speed by about 7% and increased cost by 30%

- fixed warning about performance due to changes on the idle construction tower widget on the previous version

- fixed warning about missing texture when building GEAR "Proteus"


2018/12/15 ------------------ NOTES v1.04 ----------------------

- fixed clearing of map markers and drawings every few seconds which shouldn't happen (leftover from AI debug)

- settings widget enforce 10k nanoparticles limit and sets mouse scroll wheel speed to -25
(the latter should prevent new players from bumping into the annoying inverted mousewheel zoom issue)

- fixed invisible hull sections on GEAR "Executioner" and "Jigsaw" ships and added thruster tubes on all ship models
- GEAR "Jigsaw" back turret raises significantly higher as the laser can shoot over the front turret

- increased icon size for level2 factories
- reduced icon size for construction towers
- added icons for magnetar, radars and radar jammers

- fixed expenditure labels and values on the resource bars

- made ruby and obsidian lightning beams more intense visually

--- AI

- make AI less likely to get stuck without making level1 and level2 factories



2018/11/22 ------------------ NOTES v1.01 ----------------------


--- new units

- added AVEN "Perceptor" : Intelligence hovercraft. Provides radar, sonar and radar jammer


--- balance / mechanics

- Fixed GEAR energy storage not being able to be built underwater
- increased the terrain slope tolerance and reduced the death blast damage of AVEN "Runner" to match the other small robots
- AVEN "Knight" has move state set to "hold position" by default
- increased the movement footprint for a many small and medium robots so they'll clump together less when moving in groups
- removed the 2x vertical range bonus on short range flamethrowers (GEAR) and laser cutter weapons (CLAW)
- CLAW "Slayer" form commander gets 10% increased speed and 10% reduced range
- CLAW "Sword" : reduced laser cutter range by 10%
(this means flamethrower and laser cutter units can no longer hit air in most situations)

--- AI

- more likely to build wind generators
- fixed AI not building geothermal generators
- fixed issue with MFAI assigning too many builders to dedicated roles and not leaving any to build level2 factories back in base
- fixed AI skipping level2 factories unless it had significant surplus energy and full stores
- AI builds radar and radar jammer units from the advanced factories earlier and is more likely to rebuild them if they're destroyed
- more likely to build artillery units against enemies who make lots of static defenses
- AI builders tasked with building metal extractors now build defenses and radars nearby instead of spending time moving around
- fixed check for idle builders to avoid them getting stuck
- less likely to move relatively fast units from the main party to the raiding party if unable to attack (requires much longer periods where it's unable to do so)
- normal MFAI is slightly more conservative when attacking (will try to grow its numbers further before doing so)

--- UI/visuals

- change dust particles from small and medium explosions to be more noticeable while keeping them finer for large explosions
- modified the chat widget to avoid breaking words when splitting text to lines
- modified AVEN Bolter's model to make it look less blocky and reflect its light armored status



2018/10/18 ------------------ NOTES v1.000 ----------------------


--- new units

- added long range rocket platforms for all factions (level 2), which can hold up to 4 rockets each
- the rockets have relatively low HP and L armor type and can be shot down by enemy weapons which target fast units and aircraft effectively and have good range
- the rockets' range covers the whole map

New rocket types:
- Nuclear Missile: expensive missile that will likely kill all units on a large radius unless it's shot down while still far from target
- Destruction/Construction "DC" Missile: can kill small clusters of units, provides temporary vision and spawns a construction tower on impact

(these are identical for all factions : faction-specific ones may be added at a later date)


--- balance / mechanics

GENERAL
- fortification walls have H armor instead of M

- comsat stations reveal the targeted area for 30s instead of 15s
- fixed issue with comsat beacons being targetable and blocking projectiles

- made relatively slow units and defenses and units with relatively high HP/cost up to 10% cheaper
- made relatively fast units or units with relatively powerful and long-ranged weapons up to 10% more expensive

- reduced the death explosion damage and area of effect for most level 1 ground units

- removed experience gain by dealing the killing blow to enemy units
(this means that having the HP bar drained by enemy fire is now worth 50% as much experience as killing an enemy of equal value instead of 25%)

- removed obscure flanking mechanic unless specifically stated
(units took up to twice as much damage when being hit from different directions)

- increased the HP and speed of level 1 light tanks by about 10% and adjusted the cost

- GEAR "Canister" and "Eruptor" are set to hold position by default
- GEAR "Infernal" form commander got about 5% less direct weapon damage on the fireball cannon and 5% increased range on the torpedo weapon
- replaced GEAR "Crock" with "Rhino" : Amphibious assault gun with 33% front-back dmg resistance bonus/penalty a forward-only cannon and a secondary laser turret
- CLAW "Assassin" form commander got about 5% less range, reduced HP by 100 and 25% higher reload time on its torpedo weapon
- CLAW "Longhorn" : increase model height to compensate for its flatter trajectory
- SPHERE "Emerald" form commander got 5% more movement speed but 9% reduced range and reduced energy cost to fire from 160 to 120 E/s
- SPHERE "Nova" form commander got 10% increased range
- SPHERE "Ruby" form commander got 15% reduced energy cost to fire
- increased the HP of SPHERE "Rock" and "Slicer" by about 10% and adjusted the cost

MISSILES/AA
- increase damage and reload time for light missiles by about 20-40%
- make large fast missiles L damage instead of M and reduce the area of effect (from 80-120 to 60)
- reduced range by 200 on static launchers, increased turret turn rates and reduced pop-up delay and reduced the unit costs significantly
(this increases the effectiveness against light units and aircraft, including long range rockets, relative to against medium/heavy armored units)
- missiles have cylinder targeting with 2x range altitude limit and fly a bit faster
(so they're also better at shooting down long range rockets)
- CLAW "Hyper" is a bit taller when open and also slightly improved the model


UPGRADES
- changed minor regen upgrade to give 1 + 0.1%HP per second instead of 2 HP/s
- increased flat regen on major regen upgrade from +2 to +3 HP/s


--- UI / Visuals

- Made lasers thicker to make them shinier
- SPHERE "Opal" beams and forms have been renamed to "Emerald"
- big explosions shake the camera
- used a rounder model (more faces) for SPHERE "Chroma" and "Magnetar"
- moving mouse to the upper part of the screen will show a less intrusive "press space to view chat" hint instead of showing the chat
- GEAR "Heater" tank has a longer and narrower body to differentiate it more from the "squarer" slower tanks

--- AI
- SPHERE AI will make more long range missile towers instead of static sphere towers
- AI moves attacking groups more decisively when targeting undefended clusters of enemies
- fixed AI definition of number of builders by task type


2018/08/19 ------------------ NOTES v0.999 ----------------------

- fixed MFAI sometimes morphing its commander immediately when the game starts


2018/08/19 ------------------ NOTES v0.998 ----------------------

- fixed walls providing sight like other player-owned buildings


2018/08/19 ------------------ NOTES v0.997 ----------------------


--- balance / mechanics

GENERAL
- roughly doubled the speed of blast waves from explosions
- self-damage in general is reduced to 33% of the original value
- Large Fusion reactors explosion radius increased from 275 to 325 and damage from 2000 to 2500 and get a 5% cost reduction
- increased the cost of GEAR "Big Bob" by about 50% and removed the high-trajectory mode
(was unusually low due an error on the balancing algorithm related to having high trajectory option and two weapons - oops)
- fixed an issue with aircraft debris "shaking" on the ground
- fixed heat-rays not having the stated 30% damage drop over range
(the auto-balancer wasn't fooled so now the units get about 10% cheaper as a result)

SHIELDS
- large area shields regenerate faster by draining up to 10% (1% from small shields) of maximum shield charge per second from shields within its radius
- shields are only shared above half the maximum charge

WALLS
- increased the cost slightly and build/repair time by about 10% for fortification wall sections
- changed the armor type from L to M but reduced the hit points from 4800 to 2500
- walls no longer change to "features" when built, so they can be repaired
(this also makes it easier for your units to use own walls as cover as they won't attempt to fire through)

COMMANDERS
- added Sphere "Nova Form" commander : slow but heavily armored. Weapon has huge area of effect and can shoot in high-trajectory mode.
- GEAR "Infernal Form" commander has high-trajectory mode
(it can shoot its fireballs uphill and over walls)

AIRCRAFT / SPHERES
- AVEN "Twister" now has "L" damage emg/laser combo (better vs light units and air)
- AVEN "Tornado" made a bit slower, tougher and has "M" damage rockets
- SPHERE sphere factory can build air transports
- SPHERE flying spheres are generally set to hold position to avoid wasting energy
- modified way that energy cost when moving is calculated for the flying spheres to avoid draining the full amount when repositioning vertically while idle
- advanced construction drones are now automatically set to "high priority"
- doubled maneuverability of scout aircraft
- aircraft flying way off the map are "teleported" back to a spot on the nearest corner
(workaround for a Spring engine bug)

UPGRADES
- increased the general limit of commander upgrades from 2 to 3
- increased the cost of hp, range, damage and speed commander upgrades from 500 M to 750 M, but increased own limits from 1 to 2
- increased own limits on commander regen and drone upgrades from 1 to 3


--- UI

- changed the default side from "AVEN" to "RANDOM"

- moving mouse over chat box position if it's no longer visible shows it and scrolls to latest message
- 15s after the latest "scroll up", automatically scrolls down to the latest message

- show a warning message if the Spring engine version is different from the recommended (currently 104.0)
- show a warning message if game starts without any opponent and disable victory conditions
- show a warning message if game starts with unsupported AI players instead of MFAI

- show a warning overlay whenever the commander is damaged while out of view of the player

- fixed an issue with resource drain wrongly rounded to integer on the tooltip
- moving mouse over orders menu buttons shows default hotkey information in most cases
- do not assign "perfect" efficiency award when players resign early before any units are killed


--- AI / MFAI

- builds scout pad and uses air scouts
- improved targetting for attacking forces to be more sensitive to the direction of threats and allied units
- added ability to detach a ground raiding party which will try to sneak around enemy defenses and hit vulnerable targets
(fast ground units are assigned to it by default)
- the attack aircraft group also behaves like a raiding party and will try to sneak around defended areas
- more likely to target metal extractors and construction units in general
- set long range units to hold position to avoid them chasing fleeing targets into range of enemy fire
- construction units are less likely to run into enemies when trying to build metal extractors
- use offsets when processing game state,etc. for multiple AI instances to spread the load across multiple frames and avoid "hickups"
- reduced the amount of free metal and energy income the brutal AI gets (50 to 35 M/s) and the scaling over time
- attack aircraft group takes into account enemies which are bad anti-air when considering where to attack
- normal MFAI builds the first factory earlier so it grows faster
- avoids building factories on places which do not have a soft-sloped land connection to the base center


2018/05/27 ------------------ NOTES v0.996 ----------------------

--- balance / mechanics

- units with weapons with an AOE edge effectiveness boosts got a bit cheaper 
(5-10% cost reduction on GEAR Grenado, CLAW Nucleus, Massacre and Mega, and AVEN Stasis and Tsunami)
 

ECONOMY
- increased the base economy from 6 M/s and 60 E/s to 8 M/s and 80 E/s
(this is meant to give a bit more slack for players who want to do something other than rushing expansion)

- reduced energy cost of repairing damage from 100% to 75% of the unit's energy cost


AIRCRAFT
- air transports fly higher and change altitude faster

- SPHERE flying spheres now use the smoothed air mesh to avoid bumping into cliffs

- air mesh should follow the ground height profile more closely
(this means on maps with high hills aircraft will not climb so high unless they're closer to the cliffs)

- aircraft no longer try to fly below the altitude of the lowest metal spot 
(relevant for maps where disputed ground is on high plateaus delimited by steep cliffs)

--- UI / visuals

- tooltip over empty ground shows altitude instead of ground speed modifier (was always x1)



2018/04/26 ------------------ NOTES v0.995 ----------------------


- fixed warnings that showed up when building SPHERE geothermal powerplant 

- fix issue with name not appearing over AI players' commanders

- fixed issue which caused flying spheres and some aircraft to move weirdly due to collisions with the factory after construction finishes

- improved wreckage of SPHERE "Trax" and GEAR "Box"

- changed some of the sounds for the SPHERE and CLAW commanders and many vehicles



2018/04/24 ------------------ NOTES v0.994 ----------------------

--- new units

- AVEN "Tsunami" : Heavy Riot Hovercraft

- GEAR "Luminator" : Long Range Heavy Fire Support Robot
- GEAR "Land Mine" : perimeter defense

- CLAW "Dynamo" : Mobile Anti-Armor Energy Ring Launcher
(charges and shoots a very powerful ring that can pierce through multiple enemies, but charging can be interrupted by enemy fire)


--- balance / mechanics

- AVEN "Bass" : reload time and damage halved, to make it more consistent. It's projectiles now show a cool space distortion effect
- AVEN "Excalibur" : reduced HP by 25% and cost by 12%. Modified model to look "slimmer"
- AVEN "Swatter" : reduced HP by 25%, changed armor type from L to M and adjusted cost 
- AVEN "Talon" : reduced speed by 20%, increased HP by 20% and reduced bomb reload time from 9s to 6s and adjusted cost

- GEAR "Titan" : increased HP from 7500 to 8000 and adjusted cost
- GEAR "Flareon": turret rotates to keep firing direction to compensate for the body rotation, if necessary

- CLAW "Gyro" charge disruption threshold lowered to 25% damage taken within 3 seconds instead of 1 second

- SPHERE "Magnetar" : increase passive regeneration from 160HP/s to 250HP/s
- SPHERE "Nimbus" : missile and rocket have 600 range

- increased the damage dealt by GEAR and SPHERE long range plasma cannons and reduced HP by about 15%
(to make them more cost effective at their core role, which is long range bombardment)

- Major regeneration upgrade adds +2HP/s in addition to the 0.2%HP bonus
- Commander regeneration upgrade adds +20HP/s instead of 15HP/s


--- UI / visuals

- slightly improved some of the models, textures and walk cycles

- made unit status bars slightly bigger and easier to read
- GEAR heat rays now have a more dynamic texture
- improved the appearance of the commander name tags (widget from Balanced Annihilation, by Floris and Bluestone)
- tooltip shows different label and damage color for disruptor/paralyzer weapons





2018/02/11 ------------------ NOTES v0.993 ----------------------

--- balance / mechanics

- increased AVEN "Defender" damage per second by 45% and increased cost by 20%

- changed AVEN and GEAR level 2 fighters to shoot a pair of faster missiles with slightly higher burst damage but less range
- increased HP of level 2 fighters (except SPHERE) by 100 (10-15%) and adjusted the costs
- slightly increased the projectile speed and reduced the range of fighter aircraft
- increased strafing fighter aircraft's acceleration
(these changes make strafing aircraft more cost-effective at fighting other aircraft in general, namely hovering aircraft which can shoot back efficiently)

- modified GEAR "Firestorm" to use incendiary rockets instead of fireball cannons


--- UI

- commands for building or upgrading metal extractors in an area now show up immediately when shift-queued




2018/01/31 ------------------ NOTES v0.992 ----------------------


--- new units

- added COMSAT station for all factions : a somewhat expensive building that can reveal an area of the map for 15s every three minutes
(these are an alternative investment to having to recurrently suicide swarms of air scouts to reveal areas behind enemy defenses)


--- balance / mechanics

- when a unit is ordered to attack a target and then ordered to move, it should keep attacking the previous target while in range

- improved the lua metal spot handler so that the metal decals are perfectly centered and more visible when resource highlight view is enabled

- removed global resource multipliers and other game options as some weren't processed properly
(they may be changed/restored at a later date)

- fixed a bug which prevented commanders from capturing enemy units, but sharply reduced the capture speed to 2/3 of the normal build speed
- "Builder Form" commanders have their capture speeds and terraform speeds set to 2x the normal amounts (same as their build speed)

- slightly increased the extraction radius of advanced metal extractors to ensure that no metal income is lost if they're built beside an existing basic extractor


--- UI

- updated the name and descriptions of metal extractors, now extraction rate multiplier and energy drain is shown on the tooltip

- added buttons that allow building the various metal extractor forms in an area : basic (level1), safe and hazardous (level2)
. these replaced the metal extractor area-upgrade and upgrade state buttons
. constructors will build the level2 forms beside existing level1 forms instead of reclaiming them first

- disable game speed indicator when the game starts to avoid overlapping clock/fps indicator 





2017/12/24 ------------------ NOTES v0.991 ----------------------

- fixed MAJOR bug introduced on the previous version which caused some units to become stuck on factories and others to not be buildable at all!

--- balance / mechanics

- increased AVEN "Omega Form" commander's HP by 100

- increased scout aircraft HP from 90 to 110 and cost by 10%

- adjusted the footprint size of a few of the bigger units

- made the GEAR advanced vehicle plant and advanced shipyards wider


2017/12/17 ------------------ NOTES v0.990 ----------------------

--- balance / mechanics

- doubled magnetar's pull strength and increased the HP regen from 100 to 160 HP/s but removed the shield

- fixed scaling of collision volumes for units under construction and aircraft

- fixed metal values on some maps that rely on lua metal spot configuration

- modified the footprint size of light vehicles so that they spread out more when moving around in groups


--- effects / visuals

- added CLAW "Tempest" : Heavy Missile Skirmisher Spinbot   (reworked unit from the adv. shipyard)
- added CLAW "Haze" : Intelligence Spinbot



--- balance / mechanics


GENERAL BALANCE

- increased repair energy cost from 90% to 100% of the unit's energy cost

- removed aircraft-specific cost modifiers : they now cost about 7% more metal but about half as much energy
(they now have their energy cost set to 5x the amount of their metal cost instead of x10, like ground units and buildings)

- increased the efficiency assumption for relatively fast non-tracking projectiles, which makes some units with cannons relatively more expensive

- slightly reduced projectile velocities (10-20%) for many plasma cannons
 
- made lower weight units about 5% cheaper than bigger more expensive ones
- made units with very low HP about 5% relatively cheaper
- made units with below average range up to about 5% cheaper than longer ranged units
- made slower units and static defenses up to about 5% cheaper than faster units
- reduced cost of units which cost more 3k metal (they may still be more expensive due to the previous nerfs)
(these make most level1 units cheaper relative to level2 units, which get 5 to 25% more expensive than in the previous version)

- increased cost of level 2 air transports by about 10%

- reduced idle HP regeneration per second from 2+0.3%HP to 2+0.2%HP

- fixed collision volumes for static long range plasma cannons

- the reload rate on commanders' weapons is reduced to 25% while building
(this is to reduce the advantage commanders with high reload time weapons have when building and fighting near the front line)

- made most heavy tanks amphibious 

- reduced cost of amphibious boats by 15%
 (they get the same "discount" as other ships as they still have the 33% speed penalty on land)

- unit mass now calculated to also scale with unit hp instead of metal cost, and air units are lighter
(this affects transportability and impulse from being hit)

- changed mass limit for level1 air transports from 1000 to 1200

- made heavy units push-resistant


SPECIFIC UNIT CHANGES

- increased the DPS level 1 land scout units by about 20%

- increased the size, HP of battleships and main gun DPS by about 20%, but reduced their speed by about 40%

- added angle restriction on secondary weapon on GEAR "Proteus" and CLAW "Wrecker" so the front turrets don't shoot "through" the larger back turret

- AVEN "Gryphon" rockets no longer track their targets
- reduced speed of AVEN "Excalibur" by 10%
- doubled AVEN "Skimmer" DPS
- increased AVEN "Turbulence" DPS on missile launcher by 50% but slightly reduced range and dps on the secondary lasers

- increased HP of GEAR "Cube" robots by 400
- GEAR "Might" is now about 20% slower but 20% stronger in HP and DPS
- GEAR Cube and Titan robots are now amphibious
- GEAR "Barrel" no longer slows down on water

- made CLAW "Crawler" bigger and stronger (+20% DPS, +30% HP + 15% range)
- changed CLAW "Cutter"'s torpedo to an amphibious rocket and the laser gets +10% range but deals M damage instead of H
- changed CLAW "Trident"'s amphibious rockets : they hit a bit harder and stray less, but with longer reload time and slower speed
- changed CLAW "Sword"'s weapon from cannon to a short range high DPS laser cutter

- SPHERE "Magnetar" now regenerates 100HP/s and has radar jammer and a toggleable aura that pulls deals up to 150(L) disruptor dmg/s within 300 range, but doubled the reload time on the disruptor blast and increased cost by 20%
- reduced speed of SPHERE "Chub" by 10%
- SHPERE construction sphere regenerates 30 HP/s
- reduced E cost to move for SPHERE construction sphere, Astra and Gazer from 150 to 120 E/s
- SPHERE sphere factory can build level 1 construction aircraft


--- MAPS

- added preliminary support for some maps which have no hard-coded ground metal values but have lua metal spot configuration 

--- AI

- MFAI will use AVEN Hovercraft, CLAW Spinbots and SPHERE flying spheres
- SPHERE MFAI now builds hardened fission reactors

--- UI

- tooltip shows mass and transportability "light", "heavy" or "no transport" status for mobile units
- groups of units will try to converge near the point when given non-unit point targets as the auto-formation wasn't working properly
(it's generally recommended to click-drag when giving orders so units spread out along the lines)


--- effects / visuals

- fully charged magnetars light up the grow below, slightly
- renamed GEAR air transports from "Valkyrie" to "Carrier" to match their more "industrial" flavour
- fixed glowy effects from underwater explosions being drawn above the water surface (workaround for Spring 104.0 engine bug)
- slightly improved models of amphibious ships and CLAW amphibious robots
- slightly improved AVEN "Merl" model
- plasma cannon projectiles light up the ground below, slightly




2017/10/16 ------------------ NOTES v0.987 ----------------------

--- engine

- changed SpringRTS engine version compatiblity and requirement from 103.0 to 104.0

--- new units

- added SPHERE hardened fission reactors
(this adds a choice between the previous cheaper but vulnerable economy clusters or sturdy ones)

--- balance / mechanics

MOVEMENT
- enabled "raw movement" (requires springRTS engine 104.0)
(this means units are more likely to travel in a straight line over short distances if they can)

COMMANDERS
- improved overall combat attributes of most AVEN, GEAR and CLAW commanders by about 10-15%
(they're no longer being overvalued relative to SPHERE commanders due to their cloaking ability)
- improved the relative balance between the underwater and surface weapons (underwater weapon is generally worth half as much on all commanders)
- reduced range by 6%, increased DPS by 12% but doubled the energy consumption for the unmorphed SPHERE commander's beam
- fixed issues when trying to aim the torpedo weapon while underwater (affected several AVEN and GEAR commanders)

CLOAKABLE UNITS
- made cloakable units about 8% cheaper

CONSTRUCTION UNITS
- removed 0.1m/s and 0.2m/s and 50/100 resource storage from construction units and reduced the costs by roughly 10%
- construction aircraft build at the same rate as other builders of the same tech level instead of half, but costs increased by about 30%
- reduced construction aircraft movement speed by 20% but increased their HP by about 20%
(they're still fragile)
- increased build power of construction drones by 25%
- increased the build time for most level 2 buildings by 37% to have the resource drain consistent with the other buildings

OTHER
- fixed aiming delays that made most fast firing weapons (emg, miniguns, continuous beams) deal 10-20% less damage per second than expected
(this happened while maneuvering or against mobile targets even if they were still within tolerance)
- fixed units with torpedoes trying to target enemy aircraft

- reduced CLAW "Grinder" dps and range by about 10% and cost by about 25%
- made CLAW "Mega" significantly bigger and stronger and adjusted the cost
- made GEAR "Cascade" bigger and increased the damage per pass, but now it deals M damage instead of H and is slightly slower and adjusted the cost
(a single bomber is now much more likely to be able to destroy a single factory or small cluster in one pass and survive) 
- increased GEAR "Instigator" HP from 850 to 1000 and cost slightly and changed the armor type from L to M
- increased SPHERE "Crustle" HP from 1100 to 1200 and adjusted the cost (+6%)

- "Advanced Plating" upgrade changed from +8% to +10% HP

--- UI

- prevent sharing units to enemies
- tooltip shows build power for construction units in metal per second
(note that level1 factories are built 50% faster and aircraft have a builtin cost modifier of 7% less metal but 100% more energy to build/repair)



2017/09/17 ------------------ NOTES v0.986 ----------------------

- fixed bug where GEAR's scout pad couldn't build air scouts (oops)

2017/09/17 ------------------ NOTES v0.985 ----------------------

- fixed bug that caused a crash when trying to start single player games through weblobby or directly through the spring engine binary
(didn't happen when using springlobby, though)


2017/09/17 ------------------ NOTES v0.984 ----------------------

--- new units

- added scout pads for all factions : cheap level 1 buildings that build air scouts
(this is to discourage some rushes and early blind rock-paper-scissors gameplay)

--- balance / mechanics

- significantly increased acceleration of SPHERE "Bit" robots
- fixed SPHERE "Golem" missiles being launched horizontally
- increased damage per shot and reload time by about 20% for most missiles (damage per second is the same)

COMMANDER DRONES
- reduced the cost of commander drones by 30%
- commander drones are now automatically destroyed if they somehow stray too far from the commander (twice as far as the retreat range, or about 1200)
- intelligence drones got even cheaper and drain 75 instead of 90 E/s but radar/sonar range was reduced from 1300/1100 to 1100/900
- light drones evened out across factions, weapon's base DPS was set to 50 (up from 35 and 44 DPS)
- medium drones changed: AVEN's a bit faster and deals more damage at shorter range, SPHERE's tougher but slower and got its weapon range slightly reduced

RESOURCES
- reduced relative metal extraction multiplier for moho mines and exploiters from x3 to x2.5
- metal extractors and moho mines are now about 20% more expensive
- made metal extractors a bit tougher (from 300-500HP to 450-580HP)
- exploiters extract the same amount of metal as moho mines (was 93%) but increased energy drain from 80/s to 90/s
(this is meant to increase the payback times of rushing resource production, make exploiters more attractive and reward raiding more)
- removed energy income/cost from units that produce or drain less than 3 metal/s when moving

WRECKAGES
- units with build percentage greater than 50% explode normally and leave wreckage when destroyed
- prevent nano-frames from using self-destruct
- death explosions for most non-hazardous units and buildings deal L, M damage type instead of M, H
- AVEN "Zapper", "Penetrator" and "Excalibur" explode more violently when destroyed

- reduced speed and cost of most commander drones

- reduced slope tolerance for factories (this indirectly helps MFAI not to place them on slopes too steep for some of the units to exit)

- reduced speed and cost by about 10-20% and increased HP by about 15% for level 2 fighter aircraft

- increased acceleration and turnrate for AVEN "Runner" scout robot

- increased reload time and damage per shot by about 20% for most light and medium plasma cannons

--- AI

- MFAI will now reclaim wreckages and other features much more effectively

- MFAI global awareness and tasks updates about every 6 seconds instead of 2
(these changes should boost performance on games against MFAI)

--- UI / widgets

--- effects / visuals

- show effects when half-built units are destroyed or canceled

--- UI / widgets

- slightly lowered the minimum experience required for the COMMANDER award
- fixed the way the EFFICIENCY award is calculated (it was counting morphing, reclaimed units and upgrades as losses)


2017/08/17 ------------------ NOTES v0.981 ----------------------


- added CLAW "Slayer Form" commander : Greatly increased speed and firepower, but sharply reduced range.

--- balance / mechanics

- made aircraft drop wreckage parts when destroyed amounting to 40% of their metal value, same as other units (excludes commander drones)

- enabled an engine option to have weapons on turrets track targets a bit more effectively when either the unit or the target moves
- fixed an issue on some units with different weapons on the same turret/torso wrongly restoring position when only one is in range of target

- torpedoes from morphed CLAW commanders track their targets (same as all other morphed commanders)


--- effects / visuals

- improved CLAW Commanders' movement animation to scale with speed modifiers

- added support for MF data collection system



2017/06/25 ------------------ NOTES v0.980 ----------------------

--- balance / mechanics

- taking damage reduces build and repair rates by half for 2 seconds (resource drain is halved too)
(this allows smaller raids to be effective even if there are enemy repair towers nearby)

--- UI / widgets

- tooltip shows damage and reload time separately for weapons with reload times longer than 5 seconds
 

2017/06/03 ------------------ NOTES v0.979 ----------------------

- fixed the cost of nano-towers (they should be about 10% more expensive than on 0.976)


2017/06/02 ------------------ NOTES v0.978 ----------------------

- added AVEN "Gamma Form" commander : Laser skirmisher with increased range and firepower against heavy units

--- balance / mechanics

- Changed CLAW "Knife"'s weapon to a 100 dps short ranged laser cutter but increased its cost by about 10%

large sweep through the costs of nearly all units:
- up to 5% relative cost reduction on units with tracking projectiles
- up to 10% relative cost reduction on units with slow-moving projectiles (some plasma cannons, rockets, bombs...)
- up to 10% relative cost reduction on cheap short-ranged or very low dps units
- up to 10% relative cost increase on units with very fast non-tracking projectiles (high energy bolts, railguns...)
- up to 10% relative cost increase on aircraft, especially those with relatively high HP
- up to 10% relative cost increase on flamethrower units (compensates for the buff due to slow moving projectiles)
- up to 10% relative cost increase on units with extremely energy intensive weapons like SPHERE's lightning beams

- fix movement speed modifiers from upgrades not being applied to the order queue that the unit got when under construction

- slightly reduced speed of advanced fighters and air scouts and adjusted the costs
- fixed SPHERE "Magnetar" not firing, increased its HP from 13000 to 15000 and energy cost to move from 225 to 280 per second

- changed CLAW "Flail" weapon sound (was too loud)
- minor adjustments to the scale of some of the models

--- UI / widgets

- slightly increased CLAW "Maul"'s damage per second and cost
- reduced inaccuracy of GEAR "Dominator Form" commander's cannons

- fixed collision volumes for many units, mainly for robots which had volumes shorter than their actual height
- fixed a serious issue introduced in 0.974 that made SPHERE shielded units' collision volume flat when shields were down
- fixed GEAR "Toaster"'s collision volume and aim point inconsistency when under construction

(requirement is doubled if all their commanders are dead)
- when a player resigns their commander explodes

- GEAR Heatray towers no longer try to turn their turret while firing


--- effects / visuals

- added thruster exhaust effects for all aircraft (added LUPS system by jK)

- made the ground decal below metal extractors fade faster after they're destroyed

- reduced the transparency on projectiles from some weapons, namely EMG
- AVEN Dervish, Magnum and Racer had their "Plasma Cannon" weapons changed to "Plasma Bolt", with different impact sound and projectile
- added trail for long range plasma cannon shots
- modified rocket trails for better consistency, and to make smaller rockets less expensive in terms of performance
- made fire area effects simpler to make them less expensive in terms of performance


--- UI / widgets

- system messages are no longer shown on a separate message box (to avoid wasting space)
- improved handling of multiline messages

- fixed claw_ravager and aven_bolter's build picture
- fixed sphere_adv_vehicle_factory's wreckage

gui_xta_defenserange.lua
gui_hlight_unit.lua
unit_stockpile.lua
unit_z_selector.lua
gui_greensquares_v3.lua
camera_smooth_move.lua



------------------ NOTES v0.2 ----------------------


--- unit changes
- miscellaneous tweaks to several units
- units that explode violently on death are now cheaper overall (for example SPHERE's level1 small fusion reactor)
- replaced ARM "Raven" with "Bolter" : level 2 Heavy Rocket Kbot
- added ARM "Stasis" : level 3 EMP Cannon
- added SPHERE "Stout" : level 2 Armored Gun Turret
- added SPHERE "Rain Maker" : level 2 Shielded All-terrain Radar Jammer/Missile Kbot
- added SPHERE "Tick" : level 2 All-terrain Assault Kbot


--- widgets / GUI
- added simple and advanced player list widgets
- updated commanders name tags widget (names were missing)
- added commander selection widget (ctrl+c wasn't working)






------------------ NOTES v0.1 ----------------------

- it has most land, air and some sea units for CLAW and SPHERE

- each commander has 3 distinct upgrade paths, depending on whether you want to improve mobility, durability or range (does not improve resource generation or build power).

- has new units for arm and core as well, some of the existing units were reworked, some (maverick, annihilator, doomsday, etc.) were given new 3do models

- metal makers have been disabled, but all commanders give +4 M/s

- economy scales smoothly, moho mines provide about 3 times as much metal as mexes, for 60 E/s

- commanders can be respawned in commander respawners (which can be built by any constructor). Respawning costs 1000M and 10000E and takes about 30s (can't be assisted). Experience is saved, but not upgrades (need another 30s and +1500M, 10000E to upgrade)

- for now, it has no mine-layers, no nukes, and no vulcans (does have berthas though)

- all ground units have 600 LOS and aircraft have 720 LOS (there is no distinct radar and sonar LOS) (has LOS widget)

- not compatible with any AI, for now

- it has a special tooltip widget that shows the armor type and hitpower types of the unit's weapons

- has team color widget that makes the player blue, allies teal, enemies red

--- ARMOR vs HITPOWER
- Light (L)       (takes full dmg from all sources)
- Medium (M)    (takes half dmg from light hitpower weapons)
- Heavy (H)    (takes half dmg from medium hitpower weapons and quarter dmg from light hitpower weapons)

(throwing a mass of flashes or scout ships against medium and heavy armored units should fail miserably)

- SPHERE's unit shields protect only the owner, take 2x dmg from paralyzer weapons, and regenerate 2%hp/s at the cost of 4%hp E/s
(they take dmg according to the unit's armor type, for now)
