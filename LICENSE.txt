Game is moving away from TA copyrighted content.

ARM and CORE factions were removed and replaced with original factions AVEN and GEAR.

***** WARNING *****
Note that as of version 0.8
...there are still remaining bits of artwork from TA
- a few textures
- most of the sounds
- some icons for mouse pointer
- 3d models for wreckage heaps



----------------------------- versions 0.7 and older (2014)


***** WARNING *****
This game contains original Total Annihilation content, which is copyrighted by Wargaming, use at your own risk:
- most of the textures
- most of the sounds
- many of the models used for ARM and CORE

(the original game is more than 12 years old, though)


I used the XTA 9.6 (from 2010) as a base for the game, so besides TA content it has some of the models and effects and widgets Noruas and earlier maintainers put into it. I did redo most of the weapon effects, and also imported some of the later changes made to it by Deadnight Warrior (some script changes, collision fixes and gadgets).

Besides adding the new CLAW and SPHERE factions, some units were remodelled and others repurposed, and the balance has been reworked :  it is a different game.

It is also enriched by widgets made by the Spring community.
